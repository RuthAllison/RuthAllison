									<p><b>Forum Discussion - The future of the data scientist.</b>  In this discussion we explored the roles and future of data scientists.  In my initial post, I disagreed with Saxena (2021) regarding the future of data scientists as I do not believe that they are making themselves redundant through increasing automation.  One of my arguments was that people will still be needed to make ethical decisions that are currently impossible for artificial intelligence.  One of my peers supported this view with additional evidence from a study by Awad et al. (2018) looking at moral judgements made by autonomous vehicles which collected 39.61 million decisions from 233 countries and territories.  This study demonstrated that ethical judgements have a cultural basis making standardisation of AI decision-making very difficult. Another of my peers did find evidence that for objective tasks, rather than subjective ones, people will trust algorithms more than humans (Castelo et al, 2019). AI is seen as competent and clinical with regard to decision making therefore it is perceived to have lower empathy and make outcome-oriented, utilitarian decisions (Zhang et al, 2022).  While these may have a more favourable long-term outcome by accepting some initial harm, they can be very difficult for humans to rationalise.  Another important justification that was raised in support of the continuing demand for data scientists is the need to manage the whole data lifecycle.  Data documentation, archiving and deletion are essential parts of this life cycle and have potentially huge legal impacts if not correctly managed within the required frameworks, such as GDPR (Rüegg et al.,2014).  Although it may not be their primary function, a data scientist can support the implementation of a Master Data Management system thus ensuring all correct procedures are followed and protecting both the data and the reputation of the data processor.  Overall, although the role of a data scientist may change in the future, I think there is cause for optimism in the sector.  There are many tasks that humans can do better than AI so the immediate future is secure.

									<p><b>Forum discussion - Data Protection and Management</b>  Over the duration of this discussion some key security issues around GDPR have been made obvious, showing that while the legislation aims to protect data the implementation of it has been far from smooth.  Sirur et al (2018) pointed out that the complexity of implementation means that if data is not the company’s main area of work then mistakes can easily occur. Two main areas for concern were raised – technological and human.  Master data management systems are the first line of compliance for many companies, providing security and monitoring over who accesses what data.  There were also issues identified around the human elements of systems.  Strong master data management systems can be built but they are always at the mercy of the people who use them.   Companies may provide training but if staff do not fully embrace their responsibilities, then data breaches may still occur, with huge implications.  Staff may not engage due to several reasons, such as lack of interest or not seeing it as an important part of their role. Phan & Phan (2020) suggest that serious games or scenario-based training may help with this. While large companies have the resources to provide high quality training and regular monitoring they may also have the most staff to keep motivated and check up on.  Small and medium-sized companies may find it more difficult to comply as their views were under-represented in the lobbying efforts during GDPR inception (Schildberger, 2016).  While the role of data controller may be more of a legal or compliance position the role of data scientist can be advisory to that – offering expertise and experience in data management to ensure requirements are met.</p>

								<p><b>Data Processing Pipeline, Evaluation and Implementation</b>  This assessment was in two parts - an initial plan of how the data was to be interegated then a report showing the results of the data analysis.  The initial plan gave an overview of the dataset being used - Transport for Wales survey data regarding attitudes to transport in Wales.  The data was already processed into results tables and the raw data was not available, meaning there were significant limitations in the amount of analysis which could be undertaken.
									<br>My report focussed on the attitudes to public transport across different demographics, along with ease of access to vital services such as GPs and hospitals.
