									<p><b>Forum Discussion - The 4th Industrial Revolution</b>  In this discussion we explored the meaning of the 4th industrial revolution and its impact on society. The term ‘The Fourth Industrial Revolution’ was popularised by Karl Schwab (2015) in his article of the same name published in the American Journal Foreign Affairs.  He emphasised the advances in connectivity and communication with breakthroughs in a range of emerging technologies. A key concern for me as a parent is the availability of training opportunities in this rapidly changing job market as we have the very real situation of qualifications becoming outdated almost before they are completed.  As one of my colleagues pointed out – governments and companies must establish accessible, relevant and continuous training for evolving roles (Schwab & Zahidi, 2020). Along with the need for a skilled workforce, it was gratifying to see that my two colleagues agreed with the need for careful change management when new innovations are introduced.  Examples were given, such as the Irish voting machines (Collins, 2009) and Google Glass (Zuraikat, 2020), where the technology failed due to a poor public image rather than the actual technology.  People have concerns over the safety and security of their personal data which can outweigh their appetite for technological solutions.   As one colleague explained transparent, proactive communication along with incremental improvements can be the key to building public trust.  The opportunities provided by the fifth industrial revolution have the potential to make major improvements to the lives of many people, with the focus being on the fusion of technology and humans in collaboration.  The idea of using the strengths of both together and emphasising well-being rather than purely profit is very exciting (Noble et at. 2022)

									<p><b>Unit 3 ePortfolio activity: Correlation and Regression</b>&nbsp; This activity demonstrated the effects of changing variables for correlation and regression investigations. Even quite small changes have a noticeable effect on the results - for example, when looking at linear regression, moving a single value in the x array to be approximately on the line of best fit alters the Pearson correlation coefficient by 0.02 and the predicted value of y by about 0.5.  </p>
									<br>
									<p><b>Unit 5 Wiki activity: Clustering</b>&nbsp; The animations were really clear demonstrations of how clustering worked.  I particularly liked the example found at  http://shabal.in/visuals/kmeans/4.html as it showed that the starting positions of the centroids had a significant impact on the clusters that formed.   </p>
									<br>
									<p><b>Unit 5 ePortfolio activity: Jaccard Coefficient calculations</b>&nbsp; The Jaccard coefficient is calculated to show the degree of similarity between two sets of data.  We were given medical test results for three patients and asked to determine the Jaccard coefficient between different combinations of patients.  Gender was discounted as it was symmetrical. Tests where both patients being compared were negative were also discounted.  The Jaccard coefficient was determined by counting the number of tests which were positive for only one patient and dividing by the number of tests that were positive for either one or both patients.   </p>
								<br>
									<p><b>Unit 7 ePortfolio activity: Perceptron activities</b>&nbsp; The simple perceptron activity was very useful for demonstrating the material covered in the lecturecast.  Unfortunately the Python code for delta calculations in the hidden layer of multi-layer perceptrons would not run without modification and I was unable to fully understand where to make updates.</p>	
								<br>
									<p><b>Unit 8 ePortfolio activity: Gradient Cost Function</b>&nbsp; A cost function determines how large the error is between actual and predicted values.  This error is used to determine the optimum weights for neuron connections by a process of backpropagation.  The gradient of the function is found by the derivative - a negative value indicates a decreasing gradient so it has not yet reached the minimum.  By calculating the gradient in a series of steps we can find the minimum error.  The step size has an effect on the output - too big a step and we risk overshooting the minimum.  The size of the steps is determined by the learning rate - a high learning rate is the equivalent of big steps, the number of steps taken is the number of iterations that are performed.</p>
								<br>
									<p><b>Forum Discussion - Legal and Ethical Views on ANN Applications</b>&nbsp; It is clear that the use of generative AI tools is something that will continue to grow as more sophisticated models are developed.
While there are a wide range of positive aspects to these tools there are also negatives that requires consideration, in particular the legal aspects around content that is created.  Copyright information is used in the training data for Chat GPT (Hern, 2023) which raises questions around plagiarism and theft of intellectual property.  Training data is heavily Eurocentric and is known to contain extremist content (Hern, 2023).  As generative AI models improve it becomes harder to detect their use, calling into question authorship of work.  This also raises concerns about job security – if AI can do a job as well as a human then why pay workers wages unnecessarily?  
These should not be taken as a reason for not embracing generative AI but as starting points for appropriate legal and ethical frameworks.  In my own field of education, we are seeing a move away from students being asked to write essays, which can easily be produced by AI, to students actively engaging with the generative AI tools to produce an essay that must then be critiqued (Cotton et al, 2023).  In many ways this is a better test of the students’ subject knowledge and understanding as the ability to critique is a higher order thinking skill than the ability to produce an essay (Bloom, 1956) and would be much harder to assess without the use of generative AI.
I believe that generative AI can be a positive tool for supporting both students and businesses, but the correct safeguards must be put in place, unfortunately what those safeguards are is currently unclear.
