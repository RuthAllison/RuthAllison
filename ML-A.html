									<p><b>Forum Discussion - The 4th Industrial Revolution</b>  In this discussion we explored the meaning of the 4th industrial revolution and its impact on society. The term ‘The Fourth Industrial Revolution’ was popularised by Karl Schwab (2015) in his article of the same name published in the American Journal Foreign Affairs.  He emphasised the advances in connectivity and communication with breakthroughs in a range of emerging technologies. A key concern for me as a parent is the availability of training opportunities in this rapidly changing job market as we have the very real situation of qualifications becoming outdated almost before they are completed.  As one of my colleagues pointed out – governments and companies must establish accessible, relevant and continuous training for evolving roles (Schwab & Zahidi, 2020). Along with the need for a skilled workforce, it was gratifying to see that my two colleagues agreed with the need for careful change management when new innovations are introduced.  Examples were given, such as the Irish voting machines (Collins, 2009) and Google Glass (Zuraikat, 2020), where the technology failed due to a poor public image rather than the actual technology.  People have concerns over the safety and security of their personal data which can outweigh their appetite for technological solutions.   As one colleague explained transparent, proactive communication along with incremental improvements can be the key to building public trust.  The opportunities provided by the fifth industrial revolution have the potential to make major improvements to the lives of many people, with the focus being on the fusion of technology and humans in collaboration.  The idea of using the strengths of both together and emphasising well-being rather than purely profit is very exciting (Noble et at. 2022)

									<p><b>Unit 2 Seminar: EDA</b>&nbsp; This exercise demonstrated the importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) as an initial step in understanding a dataset before attempting to use machine learning for insights. Using the Kaggle activity on house prices I initially sought a description of the data using the .describe() function in Python.  This allowed me to see summary statistics for numerical variables.  A heatmap was used to visualise where the highest concentrations of missing values were to be found - this meant the importance of those missing values could be assessed. By looking at the distribution of factors such as house price, I could see that it was not normally distributed so I would need to carry out some transformations before regression could be used. A zoned heatmap allowed me to compare the correlation values between all the numerical variables, from this I could see where the strongest correlations lay.  It was not surprising that there was a strong correlation between the area of the garage and the number of cars that could fit into the garage as this is common sense, however, the correlation between having a full bathroom and the number of cars was less obvious. A variety of graphs were then plotted - scatter, box and whisker, bar charts - to better understand the distribution of values within a factor.  Overall this exercise helped me to understand the shape of the data before deciding how it could best be used. </p>
