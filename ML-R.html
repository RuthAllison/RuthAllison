									<p>This module was probably the one I was most concerned about/least interested in when I started the course.  I couldn't see how it was applicable to my job and my lack of coding experience made the whole prospect extremely daunting.  What I found was a fascinating topic that seemed very logical and that had the potential for a range of projects in my day-to-day job.  Learning the coding has been hard but my team-mates in the group project have been an invaluable source of support and I've found myself becoming more confident with each task.  While I struggled to write code from scratch, I reached a point with our CNN assignment where I was able to make changes to existing code because I could follow what each line was doing.  This is a massive step forward for me both in terms of skill and confidence.</p>
									<p>The teamwork in this module has been challenging due to a number of issues.  We had a group of five with an eleven-hour difference in time zones. 
 This made scheduling meetings problematic as there were only three or four hours in a day when everyone was awake and even fewer hours when everyone was available.  We did manage and met weekly for our project work. I feel that the group work has made me more accepting of differences in working style.  Within the group there was a marked difference between the people who wanted to get everything done in good time so it could be checked and revised; and the people who left everything until the last minute and trusted that they would produce good work under pressure.  Initially, I found this very frustrating but I had to learn that I cannot be responsible for other peoples' decisions - all I can do is focus on working to the best of my ability and make sure that deadlines are met.
 </p>
									<p>Overall I've really enjoyed this module and want to see how much further I can push myself to use machine learning within my projects.</p>
