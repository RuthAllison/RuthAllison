										<h1>Machine Learning - Reflections</h1>

									<p>I was initially really worried about this module as I have very little coding experience and I couldnâ€™t initially see how machine learning would fit in with my current role.  Despite having to use Python for a number of modules now, I still do not feel confident in my ability to produce working, useful code.  I was surprised when the module started that the concepts seemed to be straightforward, particularly how a perceptron works with its activation function as I have frequently taught the structure and function of neurons from a biochemical perspective.  I found the Lecturecast materials very accessible and the portfolio activities really helpful for putting the theories into practice and I now feel much more confident about coding with Python.  While I still struggle to write code from scratch I am happy that I can follow existing code and adapt it to my needs.  </p>
									<p>I struggle to learn just from reading or observing, I learn much better by doing, even (especially!) if it goes wrong.  When we were working on the first group assessment (Airbnb data) I managed to create a scatter plot of the data points then overlay them onto a map of New York by finding the code for a similar exercise that someone had done on Kaggle and adapting it to our task.  There was a lot of trial and error, particularly when it came to scaling the map correctly to fit the scatter plot, and that single plot took me in the region of 4 hours to complete however I now have a much clearer understanding of how individual parts of the code work and could repeat the task much more efficiently. 
 </p>
									<p>A similar thing happened on the second group assessment (CNN) where we used the Unit 9 portfolio activity as a starting point for building our neural network.  By making changes to the factors such as the number of filters, the number of layers, the size of the kernel and the number of epochs I was able to explore the effect of each change which really helped my understanding of the whole structure of our CNN.  For example, the amount of time the model took for each epoch changed dramatically when the number of filters increased, to the point where a small drop in the wifi signal meant the run was not completed.  This lead to the realisation that although high accuracy was the aim it had to be balanced with a run time that was actually practical and achievable in the Google colab environment.</p>
									<p>My increased familiarity with the model that the group built also meant that I could have more technical discussions with the rest of the group.  I had been worried that my lack of coding skills meant that I would have little to offer the team but I actually felt like I contributed a lot in the end.  Both assignments had elements of my code included in the final versions. </p>
									<p>The teamwork in this module has been challenging due to a number of issues unrelated to the technical aspects of the assessments. We had a group of five with an eleven-hour difference in time zones. This made scheduling meetings problematic as there were only three or four hours in a day when everyone was awake and even fewer hours when everyone was available. I took control of organisation and the majority of the team were able to meet weekly for our project work although one team member did not communicate with anyone until three days before the deadline for the first assignment.  I also took responsibility for creating a collaboration space on MS Teams for us to share our work. </p>
									<p>I feel that the group work has made me more accepting of differences in working style. Within the group there was a marked difference between the people who wanted to get everything done in good time so it could be checked and revised; and the people who left everything until the last minute and trusted that they would produce good work under pressure.  I found this approach very frustrating but I had to accept that I cannot be responsible for other peoples' decisions - all I can do is focus on working to the best of my ability and make sure that deadlines are met.  To ensure that this happened I took responsibility for making the final submissions.  I feel that my project management skills were really tested in this module, particularly working collaboratively.  As an experienced teacher I am very used to taking the lead and dictating the workflow so I found it hard to take a step back and let others take charge. </p>
									<p>Overall I really enjoyed the content of this module, despite the challenges of the group work and initial misgivings.  I feel like I have learned a lot about the possibilities of machine learning and am much more confident with Python.  I now have plans for expanding my knowledge on machine learning as I can see a number of uses for it in my current job role.  It would be really beneficial for my role if we could identify patterns of student information and behaviour that increased the likelihood of positive or negative outcomes.  This has always been difficult to do due to the number of different variables as well as the sheer volume of information that is collected about students, but I want to explore if this is a problem that machine learning could be applied to.</p>
