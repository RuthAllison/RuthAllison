									<p><b>Unit 2 Seminar - EDA Tutorial</b>&nbsp; This exercise demonstrated the importance of exploratory data analysis (EDA) as an initial step in understanding a dataset before attempting to use machine learning for insights. Using the Kaggle activity on house prices I initially sought a description of the data using the .describe() function in Python.  This allowed me to see summary statistics for numerical variables.  A heatmap was used to visualise where the highest concentrations of missing values were to be found - this meant the importance of those missing values could be assessed. By looking at the distribution of factors such as house price, I could see that it was not normally distributed so I would need to carry out some transformations before regression could be used. A zoned heatmap allowed me to compare the correlation values between all the numerical variables, from this I could see where the strongest correlations lay.  It was not surprising that there was a strong correlation between the area of the garage and the number of cars that could fit into the garage as this is common sense, however, the correlation between having a full bathroom and the number of cars was less obvious. A variety of graphs were then plotted - scatter, box and whisker, bar charts - to better understand the distribution of values within a factor.  Overall this exercise helped me to understand the shape of the data before deciding how it could best be used</p><br>
									<p><b>Unit 4 Seminar - Linear regression with Scikit-Learn</b>&nbsp; This exercise used global population sizes and GDP values to determine if there was a correlation between the two values.  A scatter plot of mean population against mean GDP for the years 2001-2021 showed that there was little correlation.  The data was split into 80% train and 20% test datasets for regression analysis.  Analysis of the regression model gave a r-squared value of 0.16 meaning the data is a very poor fit to the regression line.</p>
