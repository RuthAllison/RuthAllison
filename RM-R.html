									<p>In the role of Project Leader for Assessments and Data Analytics for an International Education Provider I see a lot of student information, including personal data.  In order to carry out wider investigations, or deeper dives into the data I must combine information from multiple sources, such as admissions spreadsheets, the virtual learning environment (Moodle) and the student management system (KSS). </p> 
									<p>The issues that are most commonly raised about data analysis are about consent and privacy – when students apply for a place at a UK college do they understand what their data will be used for?  </p>	
									<p>Students understand that the information they supply is used as part of the application process and is held on file for the duration of their study and a fixed period afterwards in line with OfS and QAA requirements.  They understand that we will use the information to contact their sponsors, agents, and parents or guardians with progress updates.  They may not realise that we use information such as nationality, age or gender to look for wider trends.  Again, we can expect students to understand that we use the results from their modules and programmes for analysis but do they understand that we also look at how many times they have accessed their eTextbooks? Or that we collect the IP address that they use for sitting an online test so we can verify their location?</p>
<p>These are all legitimate business operations and, when students sign to accept their college place, part of the declaration is that their information can be used for legitimate business interests but they may not fully understand the range and information that we hold.  Given that around 95% of our students have English as a second language it is debateable how many understand the implications of the phrase ‘legitimate business interest’.</p>
<p>So the question is – do we need an additional layer of consent and, if so, how would that be managed?  What would it look like if students refused to give consent to their data being used for analysis?  At what point is a student’s right to privacy trumped by the needs of others to understand what is happening in colleges and to make business decisions?  There is also the challenge of sharing data with partners as the students progress to their university degrees.</p>
<p>It’s not an easy thing to navigate.  The majority of students are over 18 so can they withdraw consent to have their parents informed of their progress?  In the vast majority of cases it is the parents that are paying for the student to attend a college in the UK, with fees of up to £15,000 per year (before accommodation and living expenses) – does that give them a right to know how a student is progressing?  The same applies to sponsors who are paying for students to study with the expectation that they will complete their degree programmes and move directly into a job that they have committed to. </p>
<p>While, to date, there have been no issues with students wishing to withdraw consent to their data being used it is not know if this is because:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>they don’t know the UK regulations; they may not know how much control they have over their personal data </li>
										<li>they are happy for their data to be used</li>
										<li>they don’t understand what information is being used, or for what purposes</li>
									</ul>	

									<p>An additional point to consider is when does analysis stop becoming a legitimate business interest?  If the student data was to be used for a research project that is external to work requirements, e.g., an MSc research project, can this be justified?  What if the project will ultimately benefit the company – does that make a difference?  While I have the ability to access the data the question remains should I access it?  If I’m not sure that students understand what they are consenting to with regards to the company using their data, then I’m certain that they have not consented to it being used for an outside project, no matter how well intentioned.</p>
									<p>In order to ensure that legal requirements are met it is important to meet with the experts in the legal team who are best placed to advise on processes and procedures.  Their advice was that data held by the company could be used as long as it was fully anonymised before being handed over for research.  All identifying variables must be removed (student number, name, phone, email address, next of kin etc.).  This would ensure that there is no possible breach of GDPR and should be done by another member of staff.  Failure to follow these steps would be seen as highly unprofessional and could have an impact on future employment prospects as well as putting the professional reputation of the company at risk.  As a multi-national company a breach of GDPR would have huge implications and be very damaging for future business.</p>
									<p>Separate to the legal issue is the ethical one.  Mühlhoff (2021) stresses the severe ethical implications of predictive analysis.  By looking for trends in data linked to students’ personal information e.g. do students from one country perform better or worse than another country, there is a risk of stereotyping which could be harmful to student success.  It’s important to remember that general trends are just that – general.  Not every student is going to fit neatly into a description and nor should they.  Students need to be seen as individuals and any analysis done from their data should emphasise this.  </p>
									<p>For example – if students from two different countries are compared it should be emphasised that the analysis is on past performance, it does not mean that new students will perform the same way and in fact the information gives the opportunity to put in place more support at an earlier stage which has a direct impact on outcomes.</p>
